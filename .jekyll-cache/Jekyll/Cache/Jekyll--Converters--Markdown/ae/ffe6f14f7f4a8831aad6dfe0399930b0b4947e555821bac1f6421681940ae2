<p>I thought i would have a look at a few web trends on google trends to see how web searches have changed over the course of the past few days to see what people turn to when there is an emergency. Seeing that there are no loo rolls or pasta in the shops i was curious to see what are some of the other items and services people lean on when times feel frightening and strange.</p>

<p>The rise in essential goods rises in search results in the UK: in this case its milk and bread.</p>

<p>Amazon is also a company who looks to profit from people not being able to go to the shops.</p>

<p>Jamie Oliver had some interest as people went from eating in restaurants to cooking more.</p>
